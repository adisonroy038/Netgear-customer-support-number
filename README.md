NetGear Extender  : If you are reading this and are looking to extend your network signal range for something like a home office, I think you will be pleased. For properties residential or commercial, fairly large over 3500 sq ft need something to extend router's range. Netgear does the job without any issue.

For setup, use the setup wizard via <b><a href="https://iguruservices.com/support">NetGear webpage</a></b> rather than wps. Netgear webpage will clearly state if your device is connected. Ensure your networks are meshed into one ssid name and extendert will auto-use whichever is the best for the device. The range extender also uses the same name so you will know what network your device is connected into at any given time. You may use one device /aptop connected into a docking station with monitor and other small devices, mostly staying in one place while you work Or Move around as you like.

You do need to "refresh" the extender. Just unplug it for a few seconds and plug it back in. About once per day.

Netgear extender will work accurately as long as the setup is done in correct way. For starters reset everything (router included and network connections) and reset up the Netgear. Different android versions, Apple IOS, different mobile devices with different adapters can work with Extender without any issues.  Find out how to login your Router and make a note of the IP address of the extender. While connecting the extender change ip, update new firmware. Correct installation will do the job at 5Ghz, improving laptop connectivity from 1 to 10 mpbs, to 125+ mbps. It is recommended to use  "one SSID name" and smart connect which makes transitioning between router to extender connections transparent, and connect to strongest available single.
